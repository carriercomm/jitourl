== Testing

JiToUrl uses GAEUnit testing framework version 1.2.8 , but doesn't distribute it within the source.
In order to run tests download GAEUnit from http://code.google.com/p/gaeunit/, copy file gaeunit.py
to application root and visit http://localhost:8080/test, or adopt port number to your local machine settings,
app.yaml file already has configured handler for running tests from the test/ folder.

There are definitely better approaches to testing, and solutions for these approaches as well, but for the 
purpose I need GAEUnit is enough. What is seen is that using other approaches is easily implementable as well.
